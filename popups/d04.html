    <p>Here we see the beginning of structure, and how proper structure creates the seat of power on the Earth. Here the work of the suit becomes sturdy and stable.</p>

<p>In Rider, we see a King guarding four golden coins. He wears a crown and is dressed in red. His feet lay upon two coins, he holds one at his chest, and rests another upon his crown.</p>

<p>In Thoth, we have a birds eye view of a castle with four towers, in each of which sit the symbols of the four elements. The castle is the indigo of Capricorn, the ground around it is the bright orange of the Sun.</p>

<p>In Marseille, there are four coins around a central heraldic shield bearing a flower and sometimes a Phoenix. Two flowers grow between the four coins.</p>
<p>The Four of Disks is home, a place of stability to rest after we have accumulated our resources. The sturdiness of our home is the source of our power. In the Ace of Disks we saw the importance of building upon a rock, here we see the importance of building with good stone and strong wood.</p>
<p>No better expression of this truth can be found than in the Three Little Pigs! The Wolf, who has easily blown in houses of straw and shrubs and eaten the first two pigs, finds himself at the third Pig’s house made of brick:</p>
<p><em>So the Wolf came, as he did to the other little Pigs, and said, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.”</em></p>
<p><em>Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed; but he could not get the house down.</em></p>
<p>The Four of Disks is the house made of bricks, the strong house that cannot be shaken by the world outside. This is our daily life, our daily bread, the things that keep our life going strong.</p>
<p>When we pull this card we are being shown our strength, and being reminded that we may need to fall back on our home, or even reinforce it against coming difficulty, if we have neglected it.</p>

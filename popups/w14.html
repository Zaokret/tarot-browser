    <p>The King of Wands is the highest of the face cards, the “King of Kings” with the biggest weapon in the deck. He holds fantastic power yet looks into the distance, hungry for more.</p>

<p>In Rider, the King is red haired with a crown of golden flames. He wears red, green, and yellow robes and sits in a high throne emblazoned with Lions and Salamanders, while a little Salamander stands beside him. His wand reaches from the ground to well above his head.</p>

<p>In Thoth, the Prince is naked, save for his radiant crown topped by a winged lion’s head. His chest is marked with Crowley’s phallic sigil. He holds a Phoenix wand in one hand and the reins of the Lion pulling his chariot in the other. The whole card is full of flames.</p>

<p>In Marseille, we have a blonde king in full armour. He is seated restlessly upon his throne, ready to pounce at any moment. His wand sits at his heel and reaches his head. He looks off into the distance, ready to conquer.</p>
<p>While Aquarius symbolizes “the people”, Leo is the King atop them. The fire of this card is doubled: the fire of Wands, and the fire of Kings. Leo, where the Sun takes joy, is embodied here. The Lion is the king of the jungle, his golden mane is like the radiant sun.</p>
<p>When I see the distant gaze of the King in Marseille, I think of Alexander weeping for there were no more worlds to conquer. I think of Napoleon, who felt the sacred fire of ambition in himself and sought for more than men had since Caesar. We must not think of the King as being almighty, high and satisfied, but rather, terribly hungry. The King of Wands achieved his position, not by desiring to rule any one thing, but by desiring to rule <em>more</em>.</p>
<p>The Page of Wands looks up to the height of his Wand; he desires to measure up, to be a knight, or with ambition, a King one day, but these sorts of desires do not make for greatness. Alexander did not wish to be a God, but already believed he was one and demanded worship. The Spartans rightly replied “If Alexander wishes to be a God, let him be.” At the other end of the King are “delusions of grandeur”. Many mad men believe themselves to be Napoleon, but it was Napoleon’s own delusions that made him such. Therein is the secret of the King of Wands. A will strong enough to make truth out of delusion.</p>
<p>When we pull this card, we can expect to encounter a strong, dominating character, maybe directly a Leo. It may also be that we must take on a leadership position. One must hold fast to their will to keep from being conquered or to keep from becoming a tyrant.</p>

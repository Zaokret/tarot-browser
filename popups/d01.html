    <p>The Ace of Disks is the seed of the earthy suit, from it all the disks grow. This is the foundation or cornerstone of an <a href="http://establishment.It">establishment.It</a> is, in some ways, the most important card in the suit, as nothing that lasts can be built on a weak foundation.</p>
<p>The image is simple, that of a coin, and flowery growth.</p>

<p>In Rider, we have a divine hand bringing forth a pentacle, a coin bearing the five pointed star. Beneath is a garden and flowery terrace. There is a path leading to distant mountains.</p>

<p>In Thoth, we have a coin bearing a pentagram and a septagram within it. At the center is the personal seal of Crowley, three interlocked circles marked “666” and the Greek around the border reads “To Mega Therion” or “The Great Beast”, this is the autograph of the deck’s creator. Beyond the central coin we have helicopter seeds and verdant imagery.</p>

<p>In Marseille, a flowery coin is depicted with four flowers. Qabalistically, this card is the “Crown of the Princess”: the Princess of the Earth is crowned by a Seed, and crowned by her foundation.</p>
<p>The divine hand of Rider is absent from Marseille, where the hands of God appear only in the Ace of Wands and the Ace of Swords, as those two elements are considered “higher”. The Earth is the lowest element, the most mundane and it is only from this base place that we can reach the highest forces.</p>
<p>It calls to mind Matthew 7:25: <em>And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</em></p>
<p>The Ace of Disks must be the rock of our further exploration. From this foundational anchor we can remain sturdy in the midst of spiritual chaos.</p>
<p>When we say that a loved one is “our rock”, this is the card.</p>
<p>Yet in Thoth, we find the helicopter seed, a moving seed, a seed that flies! Showing us that this foundation need not be literally set in the ground, a true firmness and foundation can move with us, for it comes from within.</p>
<p>When we pull this card, we are being shown a foundation, which can be material, whether it be a place where we can establish our work or where we are able to spiritually flourish. As for money, think of “seed capital”.</p>
<p>This card represents both the necessary energy and the space to build.</p>

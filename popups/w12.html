    <p>The Knight of Wands is the embodiment of fire, the true bearer of the Wand. In each depiction, we are shown figures of pure externalized energy racing toward their highest aims…</p>

<p>In Rider, we see a rearing brown horse whose rider is dressed in tattered yellow robes. This robe itself is fire, and bears the mark of its elemental creature, the Salamander. The knight wears silver armor, and his helmet is topped with a fiery plume. His wand is verdant. He is riding through a desert landscape with pyramids in the distance.</p>

<p>In Thoth, we find a black horse with a mane and tail of fire. His rider is adorned in black armor with a beard of fire and a helmet topped with a hawk. His wand is aflame. His cloak joins the great fire that fills the card.</p>

<p>In Marseille, we have a far more calm scene, a cloaked horse and his rider both gaze down from their height upon an unseen sight below. Here we see the dominance of the rider over the horse, while the others aggressively ride, this knight reigns in that strength.</p>
<p>The Knight of Wands is the highest and fieriest card in the suit of Wands. In Thoth and Rider, this is shown as aggression, and as extreme and volatile movement, while the Knight in Marseille seeks to control this fire. It is a difficult task, as fire is the element most difficult to contain: water can be dredged, dammed and bottled, air can be blocked by a wall and blown out your mouth, earth can be shaped with ease, but fire burns or dies.</p>
<p>Both Knights in Thoth and Marseille are white knuckled as they grip the reins of the horse. They are “riding the tiger” of aggression, and cannot simply turn away. The Knight in Marseille has broken his horse thoroughly, controlling his primal drives.</p>
<p>This is a struggle for many, especially children whose immense emotions cannot be fully expressed by language and freedom, and so they throw tantrums and grow angry. The Knight of Wands can be an unstoppable person firing on all cylinders, which can be exciting or terrifying. This can also be the force you will embody.</p>
<p>As Sagittarius, we can think of arrows and bullets, an extremely useful tool of aggression when pointed in the right direction. The Knight of Wands working in the wrong direction is horrible, but in the right direction it is an astounding force.</p>
<p>Therefore let us have the discipline to aim our wills at the right target, and then move ahead full speed.</p>
<p>When we pull this card, we can expect a great deal of energy either in ourselves or in a fiery person. If you use this energy well and move in the right direction, the results will be swift and certain.</p>

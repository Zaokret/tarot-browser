    <p>The Page of Disks is the lowest court card, the earthiest part of the earth. It is the seed, small in size but immense in potential. In each depiction, the young figure holds a disk which they look upon carefully.</p>

<p>In Rider, the Page is a young man wearing a simple green tunic with tan undergarments. He dons a red turban, gently upholds his disk with both hands, and looks upon it happily. Little wildflowers grow at his feet.</p>

<p>In Thoth, the Princess wears a diaphanous gown and a great fur. She is crowned by a goat’s skull. Her disk is a flower whose center is a Tajitu, a Yin and Yang symbol. She holds a scepter, with its crystal base towards the ground. She smiles, looking down at her pregnancy and blossoming disk.</p>

<p>In Marseille, the Valet is a stern young man. He grips his belt with one hand, and carefully inspects the disk he holds in the other. His feet are pointed in each direction upon barren soil. A few scrubs grow in the waste, but his duty is to bring the earth to life.</p>
<p>The role of this card is to restore life to the barren Earth. Each year, we see plant life die in the winter and begin to blossom again in the spring: this is the place of the Page, themselves the fertile earth.</p>
<p>This fertility extends beyond the flora and to the animal in Thoth. The Princess of Disks is in fact the only card in the deck which features a pregnant woman. In my experience, this card has directly indicated a real pregnancy multiple times. Beyond the physical, this is the natural mind of man, untouched and fertile, ready for inspiration.</p>
<p>It can help to understand this card alongside a concept from the Tao Te Ching: <strong>Pu 樸</strong></p>
<p>The characters in this name are Tree and Forest, and is commonly known as “Uncarved Wood”; the wood still in the forest. This is akin to a slab of marble still held in a quarry, not yet sculpted. In the west we have similar concepts, like “Carte Blanche”, a blank paper with which we can dictate freely.</p>
<p>The Page is a person given a blank check, a blank piece of paper, a block of wood, or a slab of marble. It is what they do with this tabula rasa that matters. In this way, the Princess as a future mother and her unborn child are perfect symbols of infinite potential.</p>
<p>When pulling this card, we are to be given something that we must work upon. One may have to build from the ground up or start a grassroots project. We may become increasingly receptive to inspiration, or, indeed, become literally pregnant.</p>

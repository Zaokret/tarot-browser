<p>The Hanged Man is a card of self sacrifice. In each depiction, a man is hung by his foot, his legs crossed, as he looks ahead. As to the reward for this self sacrifice, each deck has a very different answer.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/65ca8126025b8b2aeb60b542/d17bebb9-c36c-488c-af6c-73f874e7da32/Screenshot+2024-07-05+at+22.51.02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In Marseille, we see a man in colorful clothes hung by his foot, his blonde hair hanging out. The card is framed by a simple wooden structure upon which he hangs.</p>

<p>In Rider, we have a similar image but, significantly, he is hung upon a tree. About his head a radiant nimbus has formed for he has achieved enlightenment through self sacrifice.</p>

<p>In Thoth, we have a violent departure from the other two. Here a corpse-like man is hung by an inverted ankh, one of his feet and both of his hands have been nailed. The other foot is surrounded by a serpent as he dreams of the serpent.</p>
<p>In many religions self sacrifice holds the highest regard. There are many gods who are hung, crucified, flayed, ripped limb from limb, burned, and so on. They are then resurrected, restored, and gain infinite power through their sacrificial offering of themselves.</p>
<p>These stories have inspired people to live lives of sacrifice. Each deck has a very different view of this means of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Rider is an absolute affirmation of martyrdom, the nimbus indicates his success. This is Christ on the cross and Odin on the tree. As it says in the Havamal:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/65ca8126025b8b2aeb60b542/f814fd26-b53f-478b-8f3b-865c725634fa/Screenshot+2024-07-05+at+22.56.39+Small.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Symbol: The Gift of Thoth</p>
<p><em>“I know that I hung on that windy tree<br>
Nine days and nights<br>
Stabbed with a spear, and offered to Odin,<br>
Myself to myself”</em></p>
<p>This self hanging brings Odin the divine knowledge of language and writing, the Runes.</p>
<p>Marseille makes no indication as to how effective the act is, the man is simply hanging. Waiting and hanging.</p>
<p>Thoth is vitriolic in its denunciation of self sacrifice. The hanged man is left a corpse, pained and dreaming venomous dreams. This is an undeniably Nietzschean view of Christianity. Thelema asserts that the past Aeon was typified by slain Gods like Osiris and Christ, and that having progressed into the New Aeon, we no longer need to sacrifice our bodies to attain.</p>
<p>The inverted Ankh is the ideogram of this, as the ankh is the ‘Sandal of the One who Goes’ the inverted ankh is <em>not</em> going, <em>not</em> doing. The divine faculties paralyzed.</p>
<p>When I draw this card in a reading, it often frightens people. It conjures death and pain when the truth tends to be much less severe. Consider the phrase “a hung jury”, a jury that cannot reach a verdict, Or when you reach out to some but you are “left hanging” - these are both expressed in the Hanged Man.</p>
<p>As for the spiritual role of the Hanged Man, we live in a time without public execution, thus the significance of a Hanged Man has been altered significantly.</p>
<p>I find the spiritual role embodied particularly well for modern times in <a href="https://goddisk.substack.com/p/the-car-crash-a-modern-initiation">car accidents</a>.</p>

<p>This is an event with similar violence, mortality, and potential for life changing insight. One often hears of near death experiences where your “life flashes before your eyes” And many report drastic changes in their view of life after these.</p>
<p>When we pull the Hanged Man, we may be faced with long waits, a call to self sacrifice, and taking on risk for greater reward. It is up to us to decide whether we wish to put ourselves first or last, whether or not our risks are worth it.</p>

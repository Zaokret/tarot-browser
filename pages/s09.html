<p>The Nine of Swords is elemental air brought down to nearly its lowest form. This is a card of violence and regret. When it comes up in a reading, beware of your own and others unconscious outbursts, and the regrets that inevitably follow.</p>

<p>In Thoth, we find nine rusty, chipped, well used swords still dripping with blood. There is the rusty brown of Mars and the orangey red of Gemini. This card is explicit about the violent action of which we only see the regret in Rider. One is reminded of the image of Slayer’s “Raining Blood” or the mythical Lance of Longinus, which has continuously dripped blood since it first pierced Christ’s side. As Mars in Gemini, this is again, violent action mixed with indecision.</p>

<p>In Rider, we see clearly the character of regret. A man is weeping late at night, his bed bears a murderous relief, and his blanket is embroidered with astrological symbols, the weight of fate itself. Above his bed, he awakes to a field of nine swords. He is one who has used violence and has great regret.</p>

<p>In Marseille, we see eight arched swords and a central ninth sword; we must use Qabalah to grasp the esoteric significance of this mundane image. As a nine, this card is of Yesod, the Foundation, and as a Sword, it is of Vau, the Prince… Thus we have the Foundation of the Prince.</p>
<p>A dark image indeed! The Foundation of the Prince is Cruelty. His very nature being secondary, his drive is always toward ascent, not to his own goals, but simply to the position of his Father, the King. A goal which can be achieved only through intellectual, machiavellian schemes built upon a base violence.</p>
<p>It brings me very clearly to a brilliant line from the Diaries of Anaïs Nin: <em>I often see how you sob over what you destroy, how you want to stop and just worship; and you do stop, and then a moment later you are at it again with a knife, like a surgeon.</em></p>
<p>It is image of both Claudius and Hamlet in this card, the regret of Claudius’ fratricide, and the indecision of Hamlet’s revenge. Both our actions and thoughts can be profoundly violent and cruel, and as we see in these cards, we remain filled with regret long after these terrible things take place.</p>
<p>We can also look at the image of swords dangling over one’s head and be brought to Damocles, whose desire to be King puts him on the throne, and above the throne, a sword hanging by a hair, which could fall at any moment.</p>
<p>This card calls us to reflect on our desires and their ultimate consequences. Often when wronged, we want revenge, but can you live with the result?The Prince wants to be King, but can he live with himself if he murders his father?</p>
<p>When we are dealt this card, we should prepare for an outburst, or the consequences of past actions. Our actions must be perfectly aligned and just. Regret must be accepted and understood to be overcome.</p>

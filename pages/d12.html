<p>The Knight of Disks is a man with a plan. He sees the cyclical movement of the world and contemplates his movements within them. He is agricultural intelligence, for he knows when to plant seeds, when to harvest, and when to allow a field to remain fallow.</p>

<p>In Rider, we have an armoured knight, his helmet topped with a sprig, and a pentacle resembling the sun is held in his gloved hands. His black horse also bears a laurel, and they both wear red garments as they stand atop freshly tilled farmland.</p>

<p>In Thoth, our knight is in black armour and his helmet is topped with the bust of a stag. He carries a flail, and a shield in the shape of a disk that radiates solar light. His curious horse looks at the wheat field they stand in.</p>

<p>In Marseille, we have an unarmoured knight following his celestial disk. He rides a blue horse over barren ground and carries a large green wand, the only Knight in the deck to involve two weapons. It is fitting, as he is the Fiery part of the Earth, the active part of nature, the impulse that pushes vegetable life out from the depths of the Earth.</p>
<p>Where the Virgo ruled minor arcana us images of investment, returns and bounty, here is the investor himself. He is not bold or quick like the Knights of Wands and Swords, but he is also not the hesitant coward of Cups. The Knight of Disks is patient and content to wait. We can think of the Battle of Bunker Hill, when Colonel William Prescott insisted his rebels conserve their ammunition, and only fire when they see the whites of their enemies’ eyes. This kind of dangerous investment is the bread and butter of the Knight of Disks.</p>
<p>To take action years in advance and at the penultimate moment is the nature of agriculture, an effort of regular immediacy, and a plan that will outlive the farmer. This sort of thinking ahead was absent in America, when farmers destroyed their land by overfarming and led to the Dust Bowl. A good image to keep in mind with this card is a Planter’s Clock. Which notes the solar and lunar cycles, and gives the proper time to plant a given crop.</p>
<p>The Knight of Disks embodies the wisdom of King Solomon in Ecclesiastes, aware of three maxims.</p>
<p><em>1. To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</em></p>
<p><em>2. A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</em></p>
<p><em>3. A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</em></p>
<p>He takes heed of the great cycle and moves accordingly, allowing for great development and power.</p>
<p>When we pull this card, we may be dealing with questions of investment or dealing with an investor. This may also indicate a Virgo directly. When faced with this, look to your cosmic clock and see what time it is, and what the proper action is.</p>

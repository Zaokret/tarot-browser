<p>The Ten of Cups is entirely satisfied, the ooze and gunk that had dirtied the cups before has been washed away, and now clean water overflows. This is the ‘over the rainbow’ - the storm has passed and we can appreciate the beauty. This is the flow state.</p>

<p>In Rider, we find a happy family, a man and wife rejoice as they look up to a rainbow, upon which ten cups are superimposed, and a brother and sister dance for joy. A little cottage sits a ways away, and a creek runs through the yard. This image is Dorothy’s yearning dream in the Wizard of Oz, the technicolor world “heard of once in a lullaby”.</p>

<p>In Thoth, we have ten cups arranged as the Tree of Life. Clean water flows from the top cup downwards as a complex but perfectly functioning fountain. It sits atop a flat image of a red lotus. Astrologically this card is Mars in Pisces, where the force of war is made dreamy and psychic: the flow state.</p>

<p>In Marseille, we have 9 full, open cups below one large sealed cup. Qabalistically this is the Kingdom of the Queen. The Kingdom of the Queen is satiated.</p>
<p>The Ten of Cups is one of the most pleasant cards in tarot, alongside the Ten of Disks. While the Ten Disks are the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, this is the wonderful dreamland, the promised peace. This is the rainbow as a sign from God after the flood.</p>
<p>It calls to mind William Wordsworth’s poem <em>My Heart Leaps Up:</em></p>
<p><em>My heart leaps up when I behold<br>
A rainbow in the sky:<br>
So was it when my life began;<br>
So is it now I am a man;<br>
So be it when I shall grow old,<br>
Or let me die!<br>
The Child is father of the Man;<br>
And I could wish my days to be<br>
Bound each to each by natural piety.</em></p>
<p>As the flow state of Mars in Pisces, this card may indicate “oblique strategies”, obstacles that seemed immense will melt away through a strange solution.</p>
<p>When we pull this card, we may resolve lasting difficulties, find gnawing issues satisfied, or find joy in something dreamy.</p>

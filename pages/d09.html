<p>The Nine of Disks is where the fruits of our labors are made manifest in their glory. We are finally reaching the harvest -what was worked for throughout the suit, and invested properly in Prudence, now begins to reap rewards.</p>

<p>In Rider, we see a noblewoman in a long flowing yellow gown covered in red flowers. She wears a red bonnet and a falconer’s gauntlet, atop which is perched a small falcon with a red blinder. She stands in her full and fantastic vineyard, and by her feet there are nine disks.</p>

<p>In Thoth, we have three central disks, interlinking in red, blue, and green to form Crowley’s phallic and solar seal. Below there are three coins which bear the planetary Gods: Mercury, Venus, and the Moon. Above are Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars. The background is a deep emerald green. This card is given to Venus in Virgo, a careful approach to love and creation.</p>

<p>In Marseille, we have one central disk between two blocks of four disks. Two flowers with closed blossoms emerge from the center, ready to spread out. Qabalistically, this is the Foundation of the Princess.</p>
<p>The Nine of Disks is perhaps the most pleasing point in the suit;we’ve been working for a great deal of time, and now we see the great bounty in sight. This is the pleasure of a Friday, the final day of work before the freedom of the weekend.</p>
<p>As Venus in Virgo, the card relates to caution and criticality in love. Consider the scrutiny a farmer has when looking through the harvest; he must discard what is moldy, spoiled, or otherwise wrong. This is how a Virgo Venus approaches relationships, with an intelligent, seemingly uncaring eye. They will pick someone apart before they can give themselves over to love.</p>
<p>This careful, difficult process is what allows us to enjoy the fruits of the harvest - no one wants to eat bread filled with ergot or wine made of spoiled grapes. Gain represents both quantity and quality. It has done the work to increase the harvest, and has the taste to ensure its goodness.</p>
<p>Though we can expect some great benefits when this card appears, we must also keep our wits about us. Here a great deal of old phrases come to mind: a bad apple spoils the bunch, don’t put all your eggs in one basket, don’t count your chickens before they hatch. These phrases emerge from the rational, agricultural mindset which is embodied perfectly in this card.</p>
<p>When we pull this card, we will be entering a harvest period, whether this is beneficial or not depends entirely upon what we have sewn. Sow the wind and harvest the whirlwind, the wages of sin are death. If we have been diligent in our labor, we will be rewarded here.</p>

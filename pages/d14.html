<p>The King of Disks is a man of the land, and each representation rests amid fertile soil. The fruits of the labor abound, this is a man made rich by his hard work and at the height of earthly power: growth and accumulation. The work of the suit was all investment for these ultimate returns.</p>

<p>In Rider, the King looks demurely upon the pentacle he balances upon his knee. His cloak is verdant, covered in grapes and vines, his crown is rosy, and his cowl is scarlet. His other hand holds a sphere topped scepter. The throne is adorned with four Bulls and the ground below him is full of flowers and vines. His castle stands in the background.</p>

<p>In Thoth, we have the Prince of Disks working the field, lowly compared to the King who enjoys the harvest. Doing the labor needed to produce fruit, he is naked but for his helmet, which is topped with a winged bulls head. He is riding in a bull drawn chariot surrounded by vegetable life: onions, tomatoes, flowers, and wheat. He grasps a sphere within which there is a tesseract and bears a scepter topped with the globe and cross. Both he and his bull look ahead.</p>

<p>In Marseille, we find a unique King. Unlike the other three he wears no crown, just a hat to keep the sun from his eyes. A simple and hardworking man, he sits in nature rather than in the palace. There is soil under his feet, life is sprouting from it. He holds one coin, and looks aside to another in the distance. He has chosen the ploughshare over the sword.</p>
<p>The suit of Disks deals with the material world and the things that make it up. Through the course of the suit, we watch the seed grow, change, wither, and then flourish. The King of Disks enjoys these processes and cycles, and is made rich by them. This is how one can master people as well, not by dictating their behaviour, but by putting them in the right environments, providing the proper conditions, and allowing them to grow on their own. A good farmer does not always need to intervene, they simply give nature freedom to flourish.</p>
<p>The Prince is the younger King, actively farming, knowing with absolute certainty that his hard work will produce a brilliant harvest. In many ways, this is the situation of any working person. We work aware of the season we are in, we plant seeds and work the fields to accumulate wealth, to later direct others, and to eventually retire. Most Kings will fight to the death to retain their power and control, the King of Disks is the opposite. He does what must be done and retires happily.</p>
<p>History gives us examples of Kings and leaders who abandoned the palace in favor of the plough. George Washington, the first president of the United States, established democracy instead of making himself king. This decision brought comparison to the Roman consul and dictator Cincinnatus, who after overcoming an invasion over the course of sixteen days immediately relinquished power and returned to his farm.</p>
<p>When we pull this card, we may meet a figure who embodies the King of Disks, an older, wealthy, simple man. We may also need to embody this sort of natural wisdom in order to enjoy the fruits of our labor.</p>
